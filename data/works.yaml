      <p>For a client near Chicago, I provided the cataloguing, photography and design necessary to build a comprehensive special collection catalogue. I digitized most of the items, and designed and facilitated a printed, bound catalogue.</p>
      <p>This collection consists of several hundred British prints, drawings, watercolors and objects, most from the late 18C to the early 19C.  Many are political cartoons for periodical distribution, including humorous comic strips predating 20C newspaper strips by over a century.</p>
      <p>For cataloging, I used heavily modified AACR2/Dublin Core metadata; a primary limitation was to match extant records and established client preferences.  I catalogued into a custom Filemaker Pro database, wrote Ruby scripts to pull the data from Filemaker into a working XML translation format, which I could then import into Adobe InDesign.</p>
      <p>The book is being distributed to several special collections libraries across the country, including at <a href="http://nucat.library.northwestern.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=6531017">Northwestern University.</a></p>

      <p>I illustrated this book for my family's company, <a href="http://handbellservices.com">Handbell Services, Inc.</a>, back in 2000. In 2012, I redesigned the cover (and reformatted some of the book's internals).</p>
      <p>Healthy Ringing has become standard in the handbell and handchime industry; it teaches ringers and directors to play in more healthful, musical and creative ways.</p>
      <p>The book has an ISBN, and is now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Ringing-For-handbells-handchimes/dp/0615603572">available from Amazon.com</a>, among other retailers (including my family's <a href="http://www.handbellservices.com/healthy-ringing-book/">company website</a>, of course).  It is now distributed in all new ringing sets by <a href="http://malmark.com/">Malmark Inc.</a>, and has sold thousands of copies.
      <p>I originally illustrated the book, creating over 100 illustrations, both of a technical and whimsical nature.  The page layout was by a different designer.</p>
      <p>Later, in 2012, I created a second edition of the book for print-on-demand.  The original QuarkXPress documents were barely readable, forcing a bit of digital archaeology, including the restoration of at least one chapter from scratch.  I also created the new cover design, and submitted it for print-on-demand publication.</p>

      <p>I painted this in 2003, during the sabre-rattling preceding the US invasion of Iraq.  Although I am not a pacifist, the title is certainly ironic: war should only accompany dire need, a measure thoroughly unmet in that case.</p>
      <p>However, this piece is only tangential to that conflict, and concerns itself instead with a particular psychological space.</p>
      <p>It's a cliche, I know, but this painting arrived in a dream; I thought it up, and painted it in a week, as if executing a concept plan.  This is not how I usually work: paintings for me, especially oils like this one, usually take more pain and deliberation.</p>

      <p>Originally intended as one of a large set of paintings for an exhibition, the ambitious nature of this project presaged its lack of completion. Still, I still really enjoy this painting.</p>
      <p>It has some figures buried in the seaweed, and there's some symbolic stuff going on; in general, though, these characteristics are beside the point. This is a piece of abstraction leaning toward the figurative.</p>
      <p>I showed this at a friend's personal gallery space during the Pilsen art walk, back in 2005 or thereabouts, and we found it was tremendous to view with a pair of polarized 3D glasses.</p>

      <p>Any way is up.</p>
      <p>I got the idea for this painting by doing the dishes: the bubbles in the sink created a space-filling pattern I found transfixing.</p>
      <p>Later, as the work was in progress, I learned of the very similar-looking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Vornoi diagrams</a>: a regional tiling system, in which cells are seeded by specified points.  Although the two geometries have separate origins, their similarities seem to require association.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_National_Aquatics_Center">Beijing Water Cube</a> also shares this form/pattern, so this idea apparently has broad artistic currency.</p>

      <p>Water Towers are, by definition, the work of communities: they are built as common infrastructure, for a town, for a neighborhood, for a corporation.</p>
      <p>The American water tower is a defining characteristic of our landscape.  In the open, yet usually ignored, they stand as sign posts for their communities, proclaiming messages for miles surrounding: high school mascots, mottos, corporate or political logos, advertisements.</p>
      <p><a href="http://tiffanyfunk.com">Tiffany</a> and I would like to document these structures in the spirit of <a href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/95">Bernd and Hilla Becher</a>.  It's also a great way to get off the interstate during a road trip, and see regions otherwise overlooked.</p>
      <p>This project is new, in progress, and will eventually be an online application.  We are <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/oNnV5">collecting GPS data</a>, and will create online maps and full metadata for our activities.  Currently they're living here until they find a new home, a Ruby on Rails application I'm crafting.  More to come...</p>

      <p>This project concerns the construction of a high-school chemistry curriculum, using innovative techniques to convey chemistry concepts, in particular student drawing, use of software simulations, and teacher-facilitated discussion.</p>
      <p>I built the user interface and initial functionality of the software, in close conversation with students, teachers, field specialists, and learning scientists. Programming was done in Java Swing and Processing, and was created from a blank slate. Although eventually as the complexity of the necessary algorithms required the employ of computer scientists for the heavy lifting, I can claim most of the user interface design, the choice of technologies, and most of the graphics and illustration as my own. When I handed majority software development to Tuan Dang and eventually Chris Li, all major aspects of the software were operational, although not necessarily feature rich.</p>
      <p>I designed and edited 18 books, each averaging 75 pages. Each of these books underwent dozens of revisions, including at least one entire rewrite each.</p>
      <p>I created systems of graphics and illustrations for use in the software and books, including hundreds of compound molecules, nuclear representations, and several hundred quantitative illustrations.</p>

    note: |
      <p>Art museums tend to heavily rely on text. From brochures to wall texts to website search keywords, museum artifacts overwhelmingly employ textual description for their consumption.</p>
      <p>I think this is a problem. First of all, artifacts resist textual description, which is slippery and often irrelevant to visitors. Art museums habitaully provide extensive textual analysis in hopes of bootstrapping audiences into artifact understanding, perhaps driving a wedge between those with experience digesting textual analysis and an increasingly weary art-consuming public. I wish for the means to explore museum collections without text, or with as little text as possible.</p>
      <p>Tablets can be used in museum galleries themselves: they can allow non-textual search of a museum collection, from within the museum's walls. For example, a Japanese tourist, with presumably a relatively weak command of the English language, might use the tablet to discover items in the collection which otherwise would only be available to native English speakers. A tech-savvy child might use the application, opening new avenues into the relationships between items in the collection, and expanding a broadening world perspective. Or, a museum professional might use the interface to discern weaker aspects of the collection, or to find pieces for exhibition which she might not otherwise consider.</p>
      <p>This simple project is an alternative interface for the <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/">Brooklyn Museum API</a>: a small step toward these goals. It uses maps for a primary interface instead of text, and would eventually incorporate iconographic browsing. It is meant for, and runs on an Android tablet.</p>
      <p>The project is not yet finished, because of some insurmountable XML bugs in the Processing 2.0 branch. I will continue work on it once the software problems clear up.</p>

      <p>In this exhibition, using Omeka, I show items from the Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography, at the Newberry Library in Chicago, where I spent a year cataloging over a thousand road maps from the Rand McNally archive.</p>
      <p>This was a project for a class in exhibition design; I decided to use <a href="http://www.omeka.net">Omeka.net</a> to create an online exhibit, partly because Omeka has a reputation as an easy-to-use platform for this sort of stuff.  I learned it's generally OK, and has decent Dublin Core data controls (more than, say, WordPress), but the configuration of the software leaves something to be desired.  In particular, I find it a bit unattractive.  This was back in the days of Omeka version 1; version 2 may be a bit better.</p>
      <p>I intended to tell the story of Chicago, from its early days as a frontier fort until its heyday in the 20C.  I wanted to do it with maps: a great means to tell such a story. The Newberry Library has terrific maps of Chicago, many of which are both fascinating and beautiful.</p>
      <p>I have personally examined and attempted to photograph each item by hand. I built the system, wrote all text, and catalogued all items.</p>

      <p>The Art History Graduate Student Association of the University of Illinois at Chicago needed a website. I created this as per their specifications. It is a Drupal site with heavy theming and modification, with special attention taken to assure user roles were robust and reflected the nature of the organization. It also has a forum, calendar and blog capabilities.</p>
      <p>Originally, this site was located at the domain <strong>ahgsa.org</strong>. I maintain this app as a portfolio piece, although at this point it's merely a shell without much content.</p>

    note: |
      <p>This website has gone through some major iterations over the years.  The current design is brand new: I created it in the spring of 2013, using <a href="/about#colophon">a diverse set of technologies</a>, with Ruby in particular.</p>
      <p>This website is primarily an excercise in librarianship.  Although I have leaned on the existing functionality of software libraries (like Ruby Sinatra and Twitter Bootstrap) to speed feature implementation, I have taken care to develop all of the browsing and sorting logic from scratch.  I developed a category and keywording system, and am slowly ironing out wrinkles and adding features <i>a la carte</i>.  Check back soon for more!</p>
      <p>A previous design encorporated Drupal as a blogging CMS, but I found it cumbersome for this project.</p>

      </div>
      <p>This visualization takes a database of the most expensive paintings ever sold at auction, and contextualizes them. It does this by comparing the sold price of the painting, adjusted for inflation, against other goods which could be purchased for an equivalent amount of money.</p>
      <p>In this piece, I explore the most expensive paintings ever exposed to an auction, and then I recontextualize them based upon the absurd prices they fetch. For example, for the same price as one of these pieces, you could purchase a number of Caribbean islands, private jets, or even an aircraft carrier. The percentages of these other commodities for which these paintings are equivalent shows in the right panel.</p>
      <p>I implemented the user interface of this application from scratch.</p>
      <p>The project was originally constructed in Processing, during the first Electronic Visualization course at the University of Illinois at Chicago, under Professor Daniel Sauter.</p>

      </div>
      <p>This project was done in the second Electronic Visualization course at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Via a live database, the interface takes the data and presents it in a circular context, juxtaposing the age of various countries with their GDP. This allows the viewer to directly see the relative strength of, for example, European countries and sub-equatorial countries.</p>
      <p>Interaction with the database takes place via manipulation of the central wheel, which (for this use) allowed multiple pieces of information to be browsed simultaneously, as well as resisting implicit value judgments about the merit of individual nations.</p>

      <p>My preoccupation with hexagons and geography continues: a means to create hexagon-based geography.  This <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> sketch functions as a drawing machine, i.e. a basic Photoshop clone, while using an internally consistent hexagon grid.</p>
      <p>The sketch also includes a "carbon credit" system, where different hexes can have cities, and can give off or receive carbon from neighboring hexes.  The sharing mechanism functions a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, although the implementation of this functionality is cursory.  It was never a central aspect of my concept.</p>

    title: Icosahedra Tessellations
    synopsis: An attempt to discover a recursive, three-dimensional tessellation pattern.

    note: |
      <p class="lead">A sister project to the <a href="/works/magnet_icosahedron">Icosahedron Globe</a>.</p>
      <p>This is a set of tesselations meant to discern the optimal tiling system for covering an icosahedron in a simplest recursive fashion: recursive hexagon tessellation. Eventually, this will form the basis for a video game geography: a geographic framework equally useful in three-dimensional and two-dimensional contexts.</p>
      <p>Some of these patterns are more effective (in this context) than aesthetic; some vice-versa.  Basically, I put them here because they look cool.</p>
      <p>Use of the icosahedron derives from several rationales, among them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is one of the Platonic solids, gaining much from this repeatability and systematic nature</li>
        <li>It can be unfolded flat (a characteristic lacking in spheres).</li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map">It was used by Buckminster Fuller</a>, who is awesome</li>
        <li>It is constructed entirely of isosceles triangles, which allow arbitrary and infinite recursive tiling with sub-isosceles triangles. In other words, you can fill an isosceles triangle with smaller isosceles triangles, and those with smaller ones, on and on, ad nauseam.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My preoccupation with hexagons comes from their tremendous effectiveness as a two-dimensional geographic grid.  Nerdy board and video games have often shown this effectiveness. I was anxious to shoehorn this facility into the Fuller projection, in order to allow complete 3D worlds which could be accurately viewed in a 2D context: on a computer screen, say.</p>
      <p>Therefore, this project is something of a failed experiment, since I was generally unable to discover a system of hexagons which would fully and simply cover an icosahedron: after all, at its corners, an icosahedron has five sides, not six.  I came close, however, and I have not yet given up.<p>

These included a Fortune 500 law firm, a liberal arts college, a major insurance company, and several high net worth individuals.</p>
      <p>These applications were written in Filemaker Pro, which provides a lot of capability, while still allowing a single developer to launch an entire application from the ground up, and deploy it across many platforms.  These applicatios included elaborate metadata backends, and sometimes tracked thousands of objects.</p>

      <p class="lead">A sister project to the <a href="/works/icosahedra_tessellations">Icosahedron Tessellations</a>.</p>
      <p>I am fascinated by geographic projections: translation of three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane, or vice-versa.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardus_Mercator">Mercator</a> and others have tried this with varying degrees of success; in my eyes, the best all-around projection is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map">Fuller Projection</a>, which manages to minimize distortion across the globe.  The Fuller Projection uses the icosahedron: every side identical and regular.</p>
      <p>One benefit of flat, two-dimensional planes is their suitability for a regular grid.  Most three-dimensional grids are irregular: Cartesian longitude and latitude, for example, work fine for locative purposes, but create massive distortion when used for cylindrical flat-plane projection.</p>
      <p>This project is my attempt to provide a regular grid for a three-dimensional form: the icosahedron, the closest Platonic solid to the sphere.  The grid is a set of recursive regular equilateral triangles, set either positive or negative: land or sea.  Each triangle in turn could, in theory, be made of further triangles, allowing arbitrary resolution in the manner of fractal generation.  This is, essentially, a means to create form halfway between two two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces, and to trasnlate between them.  The globe can be made as regular as a chessboard, with strong implications for art, geography, gaming, industry, or other uses.</p>
      <p>Four tiles are possible, as each tile is its opposite when flipped.</p>
      <p>To explain its somewhat shabby appearance: this is a prototype, made from steel and duct tape, with movable painted magnetic tiles.  It has been handled extensively, and acrylic paint does not apparently adhere well to vinyl.</p>

      <p>This is a painting on a mannequin. Conceptually, there's not much else to it, although I'm sure interpretations could vary.</p>
      <p>Formally, there's a lot going on here.  First, the palette is limited to the absolute basics: black and white.  Much attention was paid on balance: I didn't want either the black or the white to function as figure or ground, but rather to put them in constant competition and tension.  This was a lot harder than it may look.  In addition, I worked to keep all forms flowing into one another, like an active whirlpool, an attempt made complicated by the intrinsic curves of the female mannequin.</p>
      <p>I really enjoyed this project; I've been looking for a comparable male mannequin ever since, so I might complete the gesture.</p>

      <p>The man and woman will be used first as a pair of adult shirts.  If the budget allows, I plan to create shirts for the rest of the characters, in particular the cat and dog characters.</p>
      <p>Armatures of the characters are proportioned to give maximum flexibility: I'd like to be able to use the various characters in various situations, say, like riding bikes, swimming, or sitting.  These "human scale" activities make designing characters difficult, or at least require them to possess reasonably human proportions.  in addition, Susan Berry has ideas for these characters which could facilitate many further products.</p>
      <p>This is therefore a system for illustration, or for creating products.  Several repeating components are reused among multiple characters, for the sake of efficiency.</p>

      When I first arrived in Chicago, in the fall of 2000, I didn't know what I wanted to do.  My first inclination was to write and design children's books; illustration was a sometime fascination with me, although I didn't give it the attention it deserved.
      This design was done for a friend, a T-shirt vendor named Bob Bobber.  It's "colorful" subject matter reflects a possible audience for the shirt, namely, preteen girls.  I am entirely aware of the troublesome subtext of this piece; I was 23, and a bit lost.  For example, today I might have toned down the princess programming: I didn't get it at the time.
      Still, I think it's technically well done, and I meant well.

      <p>Following is an in-depth description of a project for a Digital Libraries class at <a href="/gslis" alt="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Graduate School for Library and Information Science">GSLIS</a>.  This was done with a small team (see "acknowledgements").  The software was on a temporary GSLIS intranet, which has since come down; I do not have any screen shots of the interface.</p>
      <p>The goal was to create a functional digital library from the ground up, using the <a href="http://www.greenstone.org/">Greenstone Digital Library</a> software, an open-source platform primarily written in Java and Perl.</p>
      <p>I did not code much for this project; that was primarily Kahyun's job.  I wrote most of our content, digitized the currency, and did original cataloging.  The crosswalk later on this page was by the whole team.<p/>
      <p>Content here is arbitrary; we were instructed to find "something for cataloging."  With my team, I chose world currency, as my grandmother had recently given me a stack of small bills from her many trips abroad.  I also wanted practice dealing with special collections.  I am aware we were probably breaking the law here slightly; I don't believe it's generally legal to scan money.  I'm not printing or using it, however, and I really don't think a counterfeiter needs my help to scan a $1 bill, even if it <i>were</i> worth the bother.</p>
      <p>Valerie also contributed a sizable collection of specimens from the Brooklyn museum, adding a coin aspect to our numismatic collection.</p>
      <p>Following is text from the assignment itself, explaining the collection in some detail.</p>
      <h3>Thematic Overview</h3>
      <p>Currency is hardly benign.  Usually its impact is felt via its purchasing power, its value, but might individual pieces of currency also carry informational power as cultural artifacts?  Are pieces of currency valuable aesthetic and informational vehicles after their nominal value expires?</p>
      <p>The Funny Money digital library was created for future generations to consult high-resolution digital currency from ages past.  As the pieces contained in this library have little nominal value, as they are of recent vintage, it may be difficult to see them as collections in their own right, of national iconography and symbology, as technological relics, created with great sophistication, design and care.  In the right light they can be considered beautiful, and might say something larger about our globalized society.</p>
      <p>This library contains high-resolution, easily accessible scans of world currency of recent vintage, mostly from Eastern Europe and South America.  It will grow in the future, to include a more comprehensive cross-section of the globe, as well as links to numismatic and educational sites across the Web.</p>
      <p>Most published metadata schemas which we have perused are not a good fit for currency.  When they do deal with money at all, they deal with the issues of banks and bank documents, not as money within the context of special collections.  Therefore, we began to focus less on a metadata schema dealing with money specifically, and instead to treat the currency specimens as cultural objects.  We originally considered Dublin Core, but instead relied heavily on CDWALite for our metadata.  Eventually, since Greestone didn't seem to have the capability to use nested metadata, we flattened our CDWALite metadata schema into a flat table.</p>
      <h3>Media</h3>
      <p>The actual collection consists of scans of the paper money (front and back), as well as some other documents and movies collected from around the Web.</p>
      <p>Contains entries taken from the Brooklyn museum, including coins and related metadata.  These items can be retrieved from the database with the keyword 'coin'.</p>
      <p>Each object has a related thumbnail, and web versions of images for front and back.  Archival-quality TIFF images are also available via links.</p>
      <p>Greenstone proved particularly difficult when collaborating in a shared project; any merits it has on a local machine seem eradicated when attempting to have multiple hands in the pot at any one time.  For collaboration, there may be other better choices.</p>
