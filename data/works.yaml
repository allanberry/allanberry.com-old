    note: |
      For a client in the north shore of Chicago, I assisted in the cataloguing, photography and design necessary to build a comprehensive collection catalogue.
      I catalogued and photographed several hundred items, in addition to the organization of several hundred more already catalogued by Mr. Gordon.
      In addition, I designed and pushed through production a printed, bound catalogue.
      This book has an ISBN, and is being distributed to several special collections libraries, including Harvard, Princeton and Northwestern's libraries.

    note: |
      Healthy Ringing has become standard in the handbell and handchime industry, for teaching ringers and directors to play their instruments in more healthful, musical and creative ways.
      I originally illustrated this book, creating over 200 illustrations, both of a technical and whimsical nature.  The page layout was by a different designer.
      Later, in 2012, I created a second edition of the book for print-on-demand.  The original QuarkXPress documents were barely readable, when they were readable at all; eventually I was able to reconstruct the book, including one chapter from scratch.  I also created the new cover design, and submitted it for publication.
      This book has an ISBN, and is now available from Amazon.com, among other retailers.  It is now distributed in all new ringing sets by Malmark Inc., and has sold thousands of copies.

      I painted this in 2003, shortly after the US invasion of Iraq.  The title is somewhat ironic, to say the least.
      This work fit the strange cliche of arriving in a dream; I thought it up, and painted it in a week, as if executing a concept plan.  This is not how I usually work: paintings for me, especially oils, usually are far more pained and deliberate.
