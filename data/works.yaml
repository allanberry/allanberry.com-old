      <p>Healthy Ringing has become standard in the handbell and handchime industry, for teaching ringers and directors to play their instruments in more healthful, musical and creative ways.</p>
      <p>This is a book I illustrated for my family's company Handbell Services, Inc. back in 2000. In 2012, I redesigned the cover (and reformatted some of the book's internals), and it is now on Amazon, as well as from my family's company website.</p>
      <p>I originally illustrated this book, creating over 100 illustrations, both of a technical and whimsical nature.  The page layout was by a different designer.</p>
      <p>Later, in 2012, I created a second edition of the book for print-on-demand.  The original QuarkXPress documents were barely readable, when they were readable at all; eventually I was able to reconstruct the book, including one chapter from scratch.  I also created the new cover design, and submitted it for publication.</p>
      <p>This book has an ISBN, and is now <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Ringing-For-handbells-handchimes/dp/0615603572">available from Amazon.com</a>, among other retailers (including my <a href="<a href="http://handbellservices.com/">">family's company website</a>, of course).  It is now distributed in all new ringing sets by Malmark Inc., and has sold thousands of copies.</p>

      <p>I painted this in 2003, shortly after the US invasion of Iraq.  The title is somewhat ironic, to say the least.</p>
      <p>This work fit the strange cliche of arriving in a dream; I thought it up, and painted it in a week, as if executing a concept plan.  This is not how I usually work: paintings for me, especially oils, usually are far more pained and deliberate.</p>

      <p>This project concerns the construction of a high-school chemistry curriculum, using innovative techniques to convey chemistry concepts, in particular drawing, use of software simulations, and teacher-facilitated discussion.</p>
      <p>I architected the user interface and basic functionality of the software. This was done in Java Swing and Processing, and was created from a blank slate. Although eventually as the complexity of the necessary algorithms required the employ of computer scientists for the heavy lifting, I can nevertheless claim the basic user interface design as my own, all of the graphics and illustration, as well as basic functionality. When I handed majority software development to Tuan Dang and eventually Qin Li, all major aspects of the software were operational, although not necessarily feature rich.</p>
      <p>I have designed and edited 18 books, each averaging 75 pages. Each of these books underwent dozens of revisions, including at least one entire rewrite. The most challenging aspect of these books was that their development needed to parallel the software (which they constantly reference in text); however, since the books were expected to progress linearly and the software grew in spiral fashion, such coordination became difficult at best.</p>
      <p>I created systems of graphics and illustrations for use in the software and books, including hundreds of compound molecules, nuclear representations, and several hundred quantitative illustrations.</p>

    title: A Tablet Interface for the Brooklyn Museum
    synopsis: An alternative interface for the Brooklyn Museum API.

    note: |
      <p>This project is an alternative interface for the Brooklyn Museum API. It uses maps for a primary interface instead of text, and will eventually incorporate iconographic browsing. It is meant for, and runs on an Android tablet. Unfortunately, the project is not yet finished, because of some insurmountable XML bugs in the Processing 2.0 branch. I will continue work on it once the software problems clear up.</p>
      <h3>The Challenge
      <p>Art museums tend to heavily rely on text. From brochures to wall texts to website search keywords, museum artifacts overwhelmingly employ textual description for their consumption.</p>
      <p>I think this is a problem. First of all, artifacts resist textual description, which is slippery and often irrelevant to visitors. Art museums habitaully provide extensive textual analysis in hopes of bootstrapping audiences into artifact understanding, perhaps driving a wedge between those with experience digesting textual analysis and an increasingly weary art-consuming public. I wish for the means to explore museum collections without text, or with as little text as possible.</p>
      <p>I intend text in the narrow sense, e.g. English language, or words. I contrast this with visual information, e.g. pictures and design. While visual information may be interpreted as a type of text, that is, a collection of signifiers with implicit or explicit meanings, I contend this definition does not adequately describe visual information.</p>
      <p>If an institution wishes to convey concrete meaning, it would likely choose verbal explanation. Does this then provide no room for visual information, even within institutions primarily engaged in visual culture? Artifacts must contain meaning which does not translate well to text, otherwise artists would simply write.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, text may not be the best way to engage audiences. A certain distance occurs in translation, even between different languages: details are smoothed, idioms are smothered, subtleties are lost. A description of a painting is not the painting itself, but a pale shadow. Even were museums to use visual information in ways analogous to text, information would be lost in translation. Nevertheless, the idioms of visual objects and visual information share fundamental characteristics extraneous to text, like elements of design, form and color; visual information may convey different aspects of an object than that available via textual description.</p>
      <p>To illustrate my point, if after a visit to a museum, I asked my companion whether they remember the "blue" painting we had seen together, I might receive a blank stare in response. I could expand my inquiry, perhaps describing the subject matter of the painting, or its size, or the gallery in which it hangs: further clues which may help to jog the memory of my companion. On the other hand, were I to provide a photograph of the painting, my companion would quickly have a better, more efficient means of ascertaining the meaning I intend.</p>
      <p>Visual information is not limited to photographs, however, and need not be qualitative. Were I to provide a series blue color swatches, relative representations of different painting sizes, or a map of the galleries we had visited, my companion may also ascertain my meaning, all without reliance upon text.</p>
      <h3>An Hypothetical Solution</h3>
      <p>While art museums rely on text, they do not eschew visual information altogether, of course. A visitor need look no further than the printed map provided upon arrival in a museum: the very navigation of a museum space is enabled by visual information. Nevertheless, when searching and browsing via technological resources, text reigns paramount. Usually the principle means of discovering a particular artifact on a museum website, for example, involves parsing the language used by the registrar to describe the piece. Hurdles of specialist jargon and hierarchical language-based navigation inhibit discovery. Perhaps museums might find a better way?</p>
      <p>I envision a non-textual interface to a museum collection, where museum visitors, perhaps via a tablet, kiosk or website, might explore a collection without the difficulties inherent in textual description.</p>
      <p>Such an interface may depend upon an iconographic vocabulary: a set of icons which tie like keywords to objects in the collection. The visitor might then click on an icon of a chair, and the system would return all items which had been tagged with the same icon, either by a registrar or another visitor. Such a search could presumably return items without the word "chair" in their description, like a stool, a throne, or a painting of a man sitting. Behind the scenes, the icon may well be tied to the word "chair," as software tends to rely upon textual identification; nevertheless, if such identification is hidden from the interface, the effect would be the same: navigation and tagging of a museum collection without obvious reliance upon text.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, such an interface could employ other types of quantifiable visual information. Maps might be used to parse space, or timelines might allow browsing and searching through time. Software with these qualities currently exists: Google Goggles, for example, uses shape and color to identify arbitrary images on the internet. A museum interface might well provide analogous color spectrums and shapes for direct interaction by users, avoiding the pitfalls and hurdles of translation to and from text.</p>
      <p>Such direct manipulation of visual information, as it more closely ties to inherent qualities of an artifact, may provide a closer connection with the material in a museum collection. Instead of merely consuming information about an artifact, visitors would endure less abstraction, and therefore may become more deeply engaged with a collection.</p>
      <p>It is not yet complete because of a few major bugs in the Android port of Processing, which will hopefully become ironed out with the new 2.0 branch.</p>
      <h3>A Specific Proposal</h3>
      <p>While I cannot hope to create software of the sophistication of Google Goggles, I believe I can create an interface which begins to explore these issues, and perhaps illuminates further advantages or possible pitfalls in this arena.</p>
      <p>At least, I wish to create a proof-of-concept displaying the feasibility of such visual discovery, hopefully which provides users with more success in content discovery. I believe this interface would be more intuitive, effective, and more fun than existing collection interfaces.</p>
      <p>As a first step, I plan to create a tablet application for use in museum galleries themselves. This application would allow non-textual search of a museum collection, from within the museum's walls. For example, a Japanese tourist, with presumably a relatively weak command of the English language, might use the tablet to discover items in the collection which otherwise would only be available to native English speakers. A tech-savvy child might use the application, opening new avenues into the relationships between items in the collection, and expanding a broadening world perspective. Or, a museum professional might use the interface to discern weaker aspects of the collection, or to find pieces for exhibition which she might not otherwise consider.</p>

      <p>In this exhibition, using Omeka, I show items from the Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography, at the Newberry Library in Chicago, where I spent a year cataloging over a thousand road maps from the Rand McNally archive.</p>
      <p>I'd like to tell the story of Chicago, from its early days as a frontier fort until its heyday in the 20C. One of the best ways to do this is with maps. The Newberry Library has terrific maps of Chicago, many of which are both fascinating and beautiful. Why not have an exhibition of maps about Chicago, curated from the terrific Newberry collection?</p>
      <p>This exhibition aims to provide a broad, yet shallow view of the very fabric of Chicago, directly documented via its cartography. If this exhibition increases interest in and knowledge of both how Chicago has developed over the years and also the strength of the Newberry’s collection, then I feel the exhibition has succeeded.</p>
      <p>I have personally examined and attempted to photograph each item by hand. I built the system, wrote all text, and catalogued all items.</p>

      This website has gone through some major iterations over the years.  The current design is brand new: I created it in the spring of 2013, using Ruby.  Before that, the website was made with Drupal, with a custom template crafted by yours truly.

      </div>
      <p>This visualization takes a database of the most expensive paintings ever sold at auction, and contextualizes them. It does this by comparing the sold price of the painting, adjusted for inflation, against other goods which could be purchased for an equivalent amount of money.</p>
      <p>In this piece, I explore the most expensive paintings ever exposed to an auction, and then I recontextualize them based upon the absurd prices they fetch. For example, for the same price as one of these pieces, you could purchase a number of Caribbean islands, private jets, or even an aircraft carrier. The percentages of these other commodities for which these paintings are equivalent shows in the right panel.</p>
      <p>The project was originally constructed in Processing, during the first Electronic Visualization course at the University of Illinois at Chicago, under Professor Daniel Sauter.</p>

      </div>
      <p>This project was done in the second Electronic Visualization course at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Via a live database, the interface takes the data and presents it in a circular context, juxtaposing the age of various countries with their GDP. This allows the viewer to directly see the relative strength of, for example, European countries and sub-equatorial countries.</p>
      <p>Interaction with the database takes place via manipulation of the central wheel, which (for this use) allowed multiple pieces of information to be browsed simultaneously, as well as resisting implicit value judgments about the merit of individual nations.</p>

    note: |
      <p>This is a set of tesselations meant for use in a three-dimensional context. This is an attempt to discern the optimal tile system to cover an icosahedron in the simplest repeatable fashion, in order to allow potential recursive hexagon fills. Eventually, this will form the basis for a video game geography: a geographic framework equally useful in three-dimensional and two-dimensional contexts.</p>
      <p>Some of these patterns are more useful than aesthetic, some vice-versa.</p>
      <p>Use of the icosahedron derives from several rationales, among them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is one of the Platonic solids, gaining much from this repeatability and systematic nature</li>
        <li>It can be unfolded flat (a characteristic lacking in spheres)</li>
        <li>It is constructed entirely of isosceles triangles, which allow arbitrary and infinite recursive tiling with sub-isosceles triangles. In other words, you can fill an isosceles triangle with smaller isosceles triangles, and those with smaller ones, on and on, ad nauseam.</li>
        <li>Isosceles triangles can be used to construct triangle meshes, hexagons, and hexagon maps, all of which are important tools in game design and geography</li>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map">It was used by Buckminster Fuller</a>, who is awesome</li>

These included a Fortune 500 law firm, a liberal arts college, a major insurance company, and several high net worth individuals.</p>
      <p>These applications were written in Filemaker Pro, included elaborate metadata backends, and sometimes tracked hundreds of objects.</p>
