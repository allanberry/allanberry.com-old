      For a client in the north shore of Chicago, I assisted in the cataloguing, photography and design necessary to build a comprehensive collection catalogue.
      I catalogued and photographed several hundred items, in addition to the organization of several hundred more already catalogued by Mr. Gordon.
      In addition, I designed and pushed through production a printed, bound catalogue.
      This book has an ISBN, and is being distributed to several special collections libraries, including Harvard, Princeton and Northwestern's libraries.

    note: |
      Healthy Ringing has become standard in the handbell and handchime industry, for teaching ringers and directors to play their instruments in more healthful, musical and creative ways.
      I originally illustrated this book, creating over 200 illustrations, both of a technical and whimsical nature.  The page layout was by a different designer.
      Later, in 2012, I created a second edition of the book for print-on-demand.  The original QuarkXPress documents were barely readable, when they were readable at all; eventually I was able to reconstruct the book, including one chapter from scratch.  I also created the new cover design, and submitted it for publication.
      This book has an ISBN, and is now available from Amazon.com, among other retailers.  It is now distributed in all new ringing sets by Malmark Inc., and has sold thousands of copies.

      I painted this in 2003, shortly after the US invasion of Iraq.  The title is somewhat ironic, to say the least.
      This work fit the strange cliche of arriving in a dream; I thought it up, and painted it in a week, as if executing a concept plan.  This is not how I usually work: paintings for me, especially oils, usually are far more pained and deliberate.

      Water Towers are, by definition, the work of communities: they are built as common infrastructure, for a town, for a neighborhood, for a corporation.
      Tiffany and I would like to document these structures in the spirit of <a href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/95">Bernd and Hilla Becher</a>.
      This project is new, and in progress.

    note: |
      In this exhibition, using Omeka, I show items from the Hermon Dunlap Smith Center for the History of Cartography, at the Newberry Library in Chicago, where I spent a year cataloging over a thousand road maps from the Rand McNally archive.
      I'd like to tell the story of Chicago, from its early days as a frontier fort until its heyday in the 20C. One of the best ways to do this is with maps. The Newberry Library has terrific maps of Chicago, many of which are both fascinating and beautiful. Why not have an exhibition of maps about Chicago, curated from the terrific Newberry collection?
      This exhibition aims to provide a broad, yet shallow view of the very fabric of Chicago, directly documented via its cartography. If this exhibition increases interest in and knowledge of both how Chicago has developed over the years and also the strength of the Newberry’s collection, then I feel the exhibition has succeeded.
      I have personally examined and attempted to photograph each item by hand. I built the system, wrote all text, and catalogued all items.    keywords: art, museums, android, java, processing
